| <p>Platform<br>(and Platform Architecture)</p> | In the context of eGov, a platform refers specifically to an open digital platform. This is a collection of software components (“building blocks”), which are created as microservices and interact through the use of APIs. A complex software system, which can perform multiple functions, is deconstructed into a digital platform by following the principle of unbundling. “Platform architecture” is an abstract description of the components of a digital platform and how they are related to each other.                                                                                                  |
| Building Block                                 | Refers to the various software components that make up the platform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Solution (and Reference Solution)              | <p>In the context of eGov, solutions will take the form of a software application; such applications are said to run “on top of” a platform, leveraging the various microservices and capabilities provided by the platform.</p><p>DISHHA will include certain “reference solutions”, which are intended to illustrate to the ecosystem how such solutions/applications could function. A reference solution may not be directly used, but can form the basis for an actual operational solution with relatively little effort.</p>                                                                                   |
| Program                                        | <p>A program is an initiative undertaken by a given actor or group of actors to achieve a defined mission or goal. A program can have multiple activities, outputs, and outcomes which it pursues as part of its mission.</p><p>For programs created in the context of DISHHA, one of these outcomes will be the creation of open digital platforms or their building blocks. While such work will tend to take place at a central level, these platforms and programs can further support the establishment of state-level programs that adopt and align with the mission or goals of the central-level program.</p> |
| Enablement / Enable                            | The words “Enablement” and “Enable” refer to the provision of training, knowledge transfer, and access to resources that improve the capacity of a partner to implement the platform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
