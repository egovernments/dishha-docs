#### Pillars and Impact

The Mission will holistically look at the Pillars of Sanitation and the Impact across the pillars

| Public Health and Environment |                          Driving down untreated waste in the value chain to zero                         |
|    Financial Sustainability   |                       Operations across the value chain are viable and sustainable                       |
|   Worker Safety and Dignity   | Sanitation workers have safe and dignified working conditions such that there are zero deaths on the job |



### Addressing Pivotal Problems in FSSM

Our approach to addressing [pivotal problems](../fssm/pivotal-problems.md):

**Absence of well-defined standards for sanitation**

Engaging with the ecosystem, the mission will aim to devise standards and enable compliance for infrastructure and processes in the waste value chain.&#x20;

* Standards of physical infrastructure: The platform will incorporate existing standards and set new standards in the infrastructure so that any digital solution can easily adhere to the standards that cause an impact on the sanitation sector&#x20;
* Standard processes and contracts: Within the area of control, the platform will have built-in templatized workflows that can enable ease of compliance by deskilling and training. Besides, the platform also enables recording skill and certification levels of actors

**Broken chain of custody from waste generation to reuse**

The digital infrastructure will enable to answer questions like “how did it end up here?“, “what is the chain of custody of this waste unit?“, “how much ended up in the environment?“, etc.&#x20;

* The platform will assign a unique identifier to entities and people along the waste value chain. It will make provisions in the processes to capture waste information that enables traceability along its journey through the value chain.
* In addition to making provisions to capture information throughout the process, the platform will also strive towards the adoption of reference applications and enabling extended solutions to create the data required for the reliable chain of custody of faecal sludge

**Availability of verifiable and trusted data at various levels of aggregation to all actors**

* The verified data of all the entities and the non-repudiable transaction trails shall lead to higher trust and stronger accountability. The platform will be data-driven and will use data generated through transactions for reporting and analysis.
* Public open data shall be made available via APIs for transparency. The access to open data will ensure high-quality analytics, shorter cycles for system improvement, and most importantly, enabling changemakers to become highly responsive to user and market needs

**India is not poised to convert waste to value, yet**

* The platform will capture waste transaction data and enable ensuring the quality of treated waste materials. This will help to understand waste demand and supply.&#x20;
* Besides, the platform will orchestrate matching of demand and supply, setting standards for treated waste, and defining data-driven policies to enable moving towards sustainability.

**Stakeholder behaviour is often misaligned with safe sanitation practices**

* Along with the ecosystem, the mission will aim to understand and design interventions to drive behavioral change for the usage of toilets by citizens, the entrepreneurism of treatment operators, and generating demand for treated biosolids.
* Using data, the changemakers will be enabled to understand the gaps between provisions and usage and devise suitable interventions to bridge the gaps.

### Outcomes

While addressing the pivotal problems, Mission will focus on driving these outcomes:
