# Pivotal Problem

At the core of all systemic challenges, there are a few problems that hinder a systemic change, limit someone from bringing a change, or cause the system to collapse.

| Absence of well-defined standards for sanitation                                           | <p>Current standards do not cover all aspects of sanitation and service delivery, for instance, standards of treated human waste, treatment plant technologies, and benchmarks, etc.</p><p>The ecosystem has created many standards which are not formally notified or enforced.</p><p>Where standards exist, awareness and compliance are dismal for four reasons:</p><ul><li>Many actors in the value chain do not have the necessary knowledge, skills, or SOPs</li><li>Complexities in service delivery result in incomplete or improper service</li><li>A poor requirement specification in RFPs. Model Contracts exist but are not followed</li><li>Delays in corrective action since contracts are not tightly coupled with monitoring</li></ul> |

| Broken chain of custody from waste generation to safe disposal                             | Systemic data either doesn’t exist or remains disjointed to understand how much waste exists, where, when, with whom, and why. FS tends to drop out of the value chain, untreated, it is important to know who dropped it, when, how, or where it ended up polluting the environment. The unavailability of this information hampers corrective and preventive measures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
