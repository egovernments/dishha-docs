# DISHHA

## Introduction

Drawing from the principles of societal platforms leads us into imagining a space where sanitation has shared resources, curated and evolving knowledge, and unified yet contextual solutions that speak to the needs of the community.  We believe every changemaker must have access to a unified, shared, and context-invariant digital infrastructure â€” a unified software, hardware & network solution that aggregates, secures, transfers, and operates information from multiple physical touchpoints. This enables the ecosystem to use these digital building blocks like standard lego-pieces and build context-dependent solutions. Plug-and-play blocks not only free up resources that can be used for focusing on critical non-technology elements like policy frameworks, capacity building, change management but also avoids a chaotic, siloed, and unsupervised digital space.

## **Goals**

Ensure traceability of waste _by_ enabling the ecosystem with

* Digital standards for sanitation
* Chain of Custody
* Actionable Data
* Code for Innovation

_to_ move the habitats towards zero untreated waste
