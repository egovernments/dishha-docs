## Introduction

Traceability in waste management is a great ally for changemakers and businesses to understand and mend the negative impacts on the environment and make effective decisions. Transparency and accountability created by tracking waste leads to maximum waste recovery and proper waste disposal. For it to be done efficiently, it is necessary to have updated reliable data, in one place. The digital infrastructure is capable of uniquely identifying and making provisions in the processes to capture waste information that enables traceability along its journey through the value chain. And is therefore the first step towards establishing a system to answer questions like “how did it end up here?”, “what is the chain of custody of this waste unit?”, “how much ended up in the environment?”, etc.

## **Goals**

Ensure traceability of waste _by_ enabling the ecosystem with

* Digital standards for sanitation
* Chain of Custody
* Actionable Data
* Code for Innovation

_to_ move the habitats towards zero untreated waste
